## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For All Users
1. **Never share your OTP**: Staff will never ask for it.
2. **Check the URL**: Ensure you are on the correct domain.
3. **Review Login Alerts**: If you receive a *"New Device Login"* email you didn't initiate, change your password immediately.

### For Admins
1. **Monitor the Alert Emails**: Watch for subject lines starting with `⚠️ Security Alert`.
2. **Review AI Flags**: Check the "High Risk" tab daily for anomalous behavior patterns detected by the Python service.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Login & OTP Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **OTP not arriving** | Spam filter | Check Spam folder. Our Resend API usually delivers in <2s. |
| **"Too many attempts"** | Brute Force Protection | Wait **15 minutes** for the cooldown to reset. |
| **Account Locked** | Security Threshold Hit | Contact Admin or wait for auto-unlock. |

### Agreement Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Signature won't save** | Stroke too short | Sign with a clear, full signature. |
| **PDF won't load** | Browser Blocker | Allow pop-ups or try downloading the file directly. |
